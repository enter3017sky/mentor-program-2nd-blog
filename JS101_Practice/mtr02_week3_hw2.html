                <p>When we read stories about children learning to code it‚Äôs tempting to assume that coding is easy, but it‚Äôs not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs hard. You might be ten minutes or ten hours into your coding adventure, but eventually, it‚Äôll come: the first seemingly insurmountable problem. We‚Äôve all been there, and unfortunately for some, the frustration is too much, and they give up‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänever to code again.</p>
                <p>How you learn to deal with these frustrations will define your coding career, because, at its most basic, coding is problem-solving. After that first problem, there‚Äôll be another, and another after that. You never finish learning to code; there‚Äôs always another, harder, problem to solve somewhere in the distance.</p>
                <p>So how can we overcome our frustration and keep moving forward? Here are three steps anyone can take to help overcome their coding frustration:</p>
                <h2>Step 1: Accept Frustration as Part of Learning</h2>
                <p>As adults, we are rarely tested with difficult problems. The frustration you feel when you hit a coding brick wall is unusual, and that makes it uncomfortable. To succeed, you must accept that these uncomfortable moments are part of the learning process.</p>
                <p>Coding requires a certain way of thinking, and these frustrating scenarios force your brain to change how it thinks, helping you improve in the long-run. The process of struggling and then finding a solution is as important to your growth as learning the answer to the problem.</p>

                <p>The ability to deal with and overcome this frustration, even to find enjoyment in it, is what separates successful programmers from those who fail to learn.</p>
